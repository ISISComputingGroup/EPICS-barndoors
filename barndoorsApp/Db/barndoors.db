# Barndoors Soft motor record
#
#  Macros:
#    P - base name for ioc
#    INST - the name of the instrument (This is used as a prefix for the IOC placed after P for barndoor records)
#    MTR - the IOC postfix of the motor that is being used to drive the barndoors
#    CALIB_BASE_DIR - location of calibration base directory (restrictred to 40 characters)
#    CALIB_DIR - location of the barndoor calibration files within calib_base_dir (restrictred to 40 characters)
#    CALIB_FILE - filename of the position to set lookup calibration file (restrictred to 40 characters)
#    CALIB_READBACK_FILE - filename of the position lookup calibration file (restrictred to 40 characters)
#        lookup and lookup_readback should be the same except that readback may contain gaps which are repeated 
#        e.g. for inward and outard swing of the barn doors. lookup must be strictly single valued.
#    HIGH_GAP_LIMIT highest gap value that can be set (should be covered by values in the lookup file)
#    LOW_GAP_LIMIT lowest gap value that can be set (should be covered by values in the looukp file)
#
#  NB because of the way convert record work if low gap and high gap are not covered by the calibration the convert record will linearly interperlate and thus
#   get the answer wrong. (It will allow you to set a gap of -9)
